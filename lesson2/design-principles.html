                    Hick's law is a psychological principle which states that the more options are available to a person,
                     the longer it will take for him or her to make a decision. The design is exemplified as an equation
                      where they make you see the reaction time a person would have if there are specific options. RT= A+B log2(N).

            <p>
                    The theory is that if you place points of interest in the intersections or along the lines that your photo becomes more balanced 
                    and will enable a viewer of the image to interact with it more naturally.
                    Studies have shown that when viewing images that people’s eyes usually go to one of the intersection points most naturally 
                    rather than the center of the shot – using the rule of thirds works with this natural way of viewing an image rather than working against it.

                        Proximity describes to the spacing and balance of an image. This helps to illustrate relationships among objects: 
                        the closer objects are to each other shows they should be thought of as related, 
                        whereas the farther apart objects are demonstrates how they should be thought of as separate entities.
